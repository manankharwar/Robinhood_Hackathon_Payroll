# Algorand Sandbox

This is a fast way to create and configure an Algorand development environment with [Algod](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) and [Indexer](https://github.com/algorand/indexer).

**Docker Compose** _MUST_ be installed. [Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

On a _Windows_ machine, **Docker Desktop** comes with the necessary tools. Please see the [Windows](#windows) section in getting started for more details.

**Warning**: Algorand Sandbox is _not_ meant for production environments and should _not_ be used to store secure Algorand keys. Updates may reset all the data and keys that are stored.

## Usage

Use the **sandbox** command to interact with the Algorand Sandbox.

```plain
sandbox commands:
  up    [config]  -> start the sandbox environment.
  down            -> tear down the sandbox environment.
  reset           -> reset the containers to their initial state.
  clean           -> stops and deletes containers and data directory.
  test            -> runs some tests to demonstrate usage.
  enter [algod||indexer||indexer-db]
                  -> enter the sandbox container.
  version         -> print binary versions.
  copyTo <file>   -> copy <file> into the algod container. Useful for offline transactions & LogicSigs plus TEAL work.
  copyFrom <file> -> copy <file> from the algod container. Useful for offline transactions & LogicSigs plus TEAL work.

algorand commands:
  logs            -> stream algorand logs with the carpenter utility.
  status          -> get node status.
  goal (args)     -> run goal command like 'goal node status'.
  tealdbg (args)  -> run tealdbg command to debug program execution.

special flags for 'up' command:
  -v|--verbose           -> display verbose output when starting standbox.
  -s|--skip-fast-catchup -> skip catchup when connecting to real network.
  -i|--interactive       -> start docker-compose in interactive mode.
```

Sandbox creates the following API endpoints:

- `algod`:
  - address: `http://localhost:4001`
  - token: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
- `kmd`:
  - address: `http://localhost:4002`
  - token: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
- `indexer`:
  - address: `http://localhost:8980`

## Getting Started

### Ubuntu and macOS

Make sure the docker daemon is running and docker-compose is installed.

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/algorand/sandbox.git
```

In whatever local directory the sandbox should reside. Then:

```bash
cd sandbox
./sandbox up
```

This will run the `sandbox` shell script with the default configuration. See the [Basic Configuration](#basic-configuration) for other options.

Note for Ubuntu: You may need to alias `docker` to `sudo docker` or follow the steps in https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall so that a non-root user can use the command `docker`.

Run the test command for examples of how to interact with the environment:

```bash
./sandbox test
```

### Windows

Note: Be sure to use the latest version of Windows 10. Older versions may not work properly.

Note: While installing the following programs, several restarts may be required for windows to recognize the new software correctly.

#### Option 1: Using WSL 2

The [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) for Docker Desktop contain some of this but are repeated here.

1. In order to work with Docker Desktop on windows, a prerequisite is **WSL2** and [install instructions are available here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
2. Install **Docker Desktop** using the [instructions available here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/).
3. We recommend using the official Windows Terminal, [available in the app store here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701).
4. Install whatever distribution of Linux desired.
5. Open the Windows Terminal with the distribution installed in the previous step and follow the instruction for Ubuntu and macOS above.

#### Option 2: Using Git for Windows/ MSYS 2 (not recommended)

This option is not fully tested and may cause issues.
It is recommended to use WSL 2.

1. Install Git for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
2. Install and launch Docker for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker
3. Open "Git Bash" and follow the instruction for Ubuntu and macOS above, in the "Git Bash" terminal.

##### Troubleshooting

- If you see

  ```plain
  the input device is not a TTY. If you are using mintty, try prefixing the command with 'winpty'.
  ```

  check that you are using the latest versions of: Docker, Git for Windows, and Windows 10.

  If this does not solve the issue, [open an issue](https://github.com/algorand/sandbox/issues) with all the versions with all the software used, as well as all the commands typed.

- If you see

  ```plain
  Error response from daemon: open \\.\pipe\docker_engine_linux: The system cannot find the file specified.
  ```

  check that Docker is running.

## Basic Configuration

Sandbox supports two primary modes of operation. By default, a [private network](#private-network) will be created, which is only available from the local environment. There are also configurations available for the [public networks](#public-network) which will attempt to connect to one of the long running Algorand networks and allow interaction with it.

To specify which configuration to run:

```sh
./sandbox up $CONFIG
```

Where `$CONFIG` is specified as one of the configurations in the sandbox directory.

For example to run a `dev` mode network, run:

```sh
./sandbox up dev
```

To switch the configuration:

```sh
./sandbox down
./sandbox clean
./sandbox up $NEW_CONFIG
```
